# Version Control

This module provides diff/patch operations with formal invertibility guarantees.
The system ensures that applying a diff and then reverting it returns the original
state exactly, enabling safe version rollbacks.

## Key Features

- **Diff Algebra**: Inductive diff types for different operations
- **Invertibility Proofs**: Formal proofs that apply ∘ revert = id
- **Patch Generation**: Automatic diff generation for state changes
- **Stress Testing**: 10k cycle validation on large checkpoints
